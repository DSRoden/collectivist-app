      h3.info What is The Collectivist?
        p The Collectivist is a one of a kind application that is designed to help find where you stand on a variety of topics in relation to other people.

        p Havenâ€™t you ever wondered what people REALLY think?   You will complete surveys in complete anonymity. This will allow you to be honest and up front with your responses.

        p We all tend to give answers that people want to hear.  While that may help us get along better, it stifles our ideas, feelings, and opinions.  We never reach a level of honesty that makes us more productive.  Our intent is to help you become more self-aware in relationships, enhance team building, get opinions on new products, and much more.  The possibilities are endless.   

        p In each survey, we ask you for TWO answers for every ONE question: What your opinion is, and what you think the average response is.  This feature enables us to give you accurate results of where you personally stand on a variety of topics, and how accurate you are in guessing what other people think.
